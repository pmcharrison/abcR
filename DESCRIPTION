Title: Renders ABC notation using the abcjs package
Version: 0.0.0.9007
Authors@R: person("Peter", "Harrison", email = "pmc.harrison@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package provides utility functions for rendering music 
    notation in interactive R sessions. In RStudio, the rendered notation 
    appears in the Viewer pane. These functions are intended to help music 
    researchers to visualise music objects created during their programming 
    tasks. The current focus is on displaying chord sequences, 
    but better support may later be added for melodies.
    Music notation is rendered using the abcjs package (https://abcjs.net),
    which was written by Paul Rosen and Gregory Dyke,
    and released under the MIT license.
