# abcR

[![lifecycle](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)

This package provides utility functions for rendering music 
notation in interactive R sessions. In RStudio, the rendered notation 
appears in the Viewer pane. These functions are intended to help music 
researchers to visualise music objects created during their programming 
tasks. The current focus is on displaying chord sequences, 
but better support may later be added for melodies.
Music notation is rendered using the abcjs package (https://abcjs.net),
which was written by Paul Rosen and Gregory Dyke,
and released under the MIT license.

## Authors

- *abcR*: Peter M. C. Harrison
- *absjs*: Paul Rosen and Gregory Dyke

## License

Both *abcR* and *abcjs* are released under the MIT license.

## Installation

You can install *abcR* from Github by entering the following into 
your R terminal:

```r
if (!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("pmcharrison/abcR")
```

## Example usage

Displaying a chord within RStudio:

```r
library(abcR)
view_pi_chord(c(60, 64, 67))
```

```{r, out.width = '20%', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/example-chord.png")
```

Displaying a chord sequence (pitches are given in MIDI note numbers):

```r
view_pi_chord_seq(list(c(48, 64, 67), c(47, 62, 67), c(48, 64, 67)))
```

```{r, out.width = '35%', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/example-pi-chord-seq.png")
```

Displaying a full *abc* file:

```r
view_abc_file(system.file("examples/example-song.abc", package = "abcR"))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/example-song.png")
```
